I personally don't care much about how you use this code, but 
experiance teaches me that the public code without attached license terms is useless.

Thus, here are the licensing terms:

You can do whatever you want with this code, and the author provides no warraties
regarding its functionality and accepts no responsibility resulting from such use.

Since this code bases on Zend Framework, you many be bound to provisions of
its license, which is available at: http://framework.zend.com/license
